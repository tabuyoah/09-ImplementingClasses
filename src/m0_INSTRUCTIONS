Students:

Here is how you do today's exercise, in m1_Point.

TODO 2.  It tells you to:
  -- With your instructor, understand these instructions.

Then, for each TODO 3 to the end of the exercise, you will do the following:
   -- Read the specification of the method.
   -- Examine the EXAMPLE code in the doc-string for that method.
   -- Copy-and-paste the EXAMPLE code into the TEST function
      -- Use the Tab and Shift-Tab keystrokes as needed to fix the indentation of the pasted code.
      -- Yes, the run_test_ functions are empty until you copy-and-paste in the test code.
   -- Implement and test the method.

We will code the first few TODOs together.

    p1 = Point(30, 18)
    print()
    print('Expected for p1: 30 18')
    print('Actual for p1:  ', p1.x, p1.y)

    p2 = Point(100, -40)
    print()
    print('Expected for p2: 100 -40')
    print('Actual for p2:  ', p2.x, p2.y)
    print('Expected for p1: 30 18')
    print('Actual for p1:  ', p1.x, p1.y)

    p1.y = 999
    print()
    print('Expected for p1: 30 999')
    print('Actual for p1:  ', p1.x, p1.y)
    print('Expected for p2: 100 -40')
    print('Actual for p2:  ', p2.x, p2.y)
